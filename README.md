# Data Structures and Algorithms with C++
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. Data structures are used to store and organize data in a structured way so that it can be easily accessed and manipulated. Algorithms are the set of instructions used to solve a problem. Both data structures and algorithms are essential for designing and coding efficient and complex computer programs.
